The Code Book Companion
=======================

I am currently reading the excellent [The Code Book](http://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/) by Simon Singh. This is my attempt at implementing the various ciphers and algorithms in the book, in order to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for them. Includes implementations of a Ceaser cipher, frequency analysis, Vigenere cipher and Diffie-Hellman key exchance in Javascript. More planned.
